PROJECT TITLE: 02.04 Arithmetic Expressions
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Using double and int to create arithmetic expressions. 
VERSION or DATE: 6/10/18
AUTHORS: Andy Jiang

<+s> Initializing int and double variables and concatenating was really fun. I really enjoy this lesson, especially using operators and double and int values. However, it was time consuming transforming each expressions to using int and double variables, and then correctly concatenating it. It gave me good practice on correctly declaring and initializing variables.
