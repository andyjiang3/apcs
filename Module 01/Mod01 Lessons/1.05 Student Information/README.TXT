PROJECT TITLE: Student Information Card
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Creating a Student Information Card using Java
VERSION or DATE: 6/6/18
AUTHORS: Andy Jiang

------------------------------ PMR -------------------------------------

<+s> BlueJ seems to be an easier and simpler IDE from ones I currently use, 
such as Eclipse. This assignment was very fun and made me think
creatively. I didn't run into any major errors and was comfortable
using the print() and println() methods. I am looking forward
to this course and what it has in place for me. :)
